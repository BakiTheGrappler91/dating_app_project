# dating_app_project

This project showcases my ability to use machine learning to make improvements for a business/organisation that want to deliver better results to their consumer base with the service they are providing.  The final stage of the Data Scientist - Machine Learning course from CodeCademy is a project using machine learning to improve a dating application for a fictional company.  The overall objective for the project was to see if I could create models to accurately predict attributes/opinions about customers that they did not share their profile.  Having a more complete profile would result in more accurate matches, making the dating application more successful.  I have worked on implementing two examples of machine learning, both are types of supervised learning:

    1.  Naive Bayes Classifier for text classification.  The goal was to see if I could create a model to accurately predict whether someone likes or dislikes cats based on what they had written in their biography essay.

    2.  A classifier to predict someones Zodiac sign, using logistic regression, decision trees and k nearest neighbors.
